    <h1>Exception Handling</h1>
    <p>An exception (or exceptional event) is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. 
        When an Exception occurs the normal flow of the program is interupted and the program terminates 
        , therefore, these exceptions must be handled.

    </p>
    <p>An exception can occur for many different reasons. Following are some scenarios where an exception occurs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A user has entered an invalid data</li>
        <li>A file that needs to be opened cannot be found</li>
        <li>A network connection has been lost in the middle of communications or the JVM has run out of memory.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Checked Exception</h2>
    <p>A checked exception is an exception that is checked by the compiler at compilation-time,
         these are also known as compile time exceptions. 
        These exceptions cannot simply be ignored, the programmer should take care of them before running the program.</p>
    <h2>Unchecked Exception</h2>
    <p>unchecked exception is an exception that occurs at the time of execution. 
        These are also called as Runtime Exceptions. These include programming bugs, such as logic 
        errors or improper use of an API. 
        Runtime exceptions are ignored at the time of compilation</p>
    <p>For example, if you have declared an array of size 5 in your program, and trying to call the 6th element of the array then an
         ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionexception occurs.</p>
    <h5>Example</h5>
    <div>
        <pre><code class = "language-java">{{ code33 }}</code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>Output:
        Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, this is because the index that is trying to
        be accessed doesnot exist
        </p>
    <h2>Errors</h2>
    <p>These are not exceptions at all, but problems that arise beyond the control of the user or the programmer. 
        Errors are typically ignored in your code because you can rarely do anything about an error.
         For example, if a stack overflow occurs, an error will aris</p>
