    <h1>Constructor</h1>
    <p>Constructors are methods in java that are used to initialise properties on the creation of objects,
         constructors prevent the direct 
        assigning of values to properties which takes more lines of code</p>
    <h5>syntax</h5>
    <p>Constructors must have the same name as the class</p>
    <p>they are special methods because they donot have the return type, they only have the visibility Modifier which is always 
        public followed by the class name
    </p>
    <p>it takes in the declared properties of the class, and on creation of the objects values of these properties can be passed 
        in there order
    </p>
    <div>
        <pre><code class = "language-java">{{ code10 }}</code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>In the example above a constructor is created in a class called Student and they have the same name, the declared properties are passed in the constructor
        and <b>this</b> key word is used to define the properties in that when values are passed on the creation of objects they are assigned directly to those exact variables

    </p>
    <p>And you can access the variables through the objects as shown above</p>
    <div class="navigation">
        <a href="{% url 'visibility' %}" class="nav-link previous">&larr; Previous</a>
        <a href="{% url 'arrays' %}" class="nav-link next">Next &rarr;</a>
      </div>
