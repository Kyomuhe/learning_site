    <h1>Object Casting</h1>
    <p>Objects of a class can be cast into objects of another class if both classes are related to each other through
         the property of inheritance</p>
    <p>There are two types of object casting 
        <ol>
            <li>Upcasting</li>
            <li>Downcasting</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>upcasting/implicit:</h4>
    <p>this refers to the process of converting an object of a subclass to an object of its superclass, 
        it is safe and automatic</p>
    <p>Example: </p>
    <div>
        <pre><code class="language-java">{{ code48 }}</code></pre>
    </div>
    <p><b>Note:</b>In upcasting the object can access only fields accessed in the super class and 
        methods unless when the method is overridden in the sub class.
        but it cant access fields only defined in the sub class. in that Any additional fields or methods that 
        are specific to the subclass are not directly accessible using an upcasted reference.

        However, if a method is overridden in the subclass, then when you call that method using an upcasted 
        reference, the overridden method in the subclass will be executed, not the method from the superclass.
        
        </p>
    <h4>Downcasting/Explicit </h4>
    <p>it refers to the process of converting an object of a superclass to an object of its subclass,
        down casting requires explicit 
        casting and it is not always safe.</p>
    <p><b>Syntax</b></p>
    <div>
        <pre><code class="language-java">{{ code49 }}</code></pre>
    </div>
    <p><b>Note:</b>in downcasting the object can access all the methods and fields in both the super class and the 
        sub class and for methods if it is overridden in the sub class it will print the
         one in the subclass</p>
    <div class="navigation">
        <a href="{% url 'clone' %}" class="nav-link previous">&larr; Previous</a>
        <a href="{% url 'inner' %}" class="nav-link next">Next &rarr;</a>
