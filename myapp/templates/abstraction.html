    <h1>Abstraction</h1>
    <p>Abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing 
        only essential information to the user. Abstract classes help implement Abstraction</p>
    <p>An Abstract class is a class which is incomplete and has a keyword abstract between the visibility modifier
        and the keyword class e.g <b>public abstract class A{ }</b></p>
    <p>Since an abstract class is incomplete it cant be instantiated, if a class A is an abstract this statement 
        <b>A obj = new A();</b>
        will bring an error because abstract classes can not have objects</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> A class which is not abstract is concrete</p>
    <p>For a class to be abstract it must satisfy the following </p>
    <ul>
        <li>it must be defined with the keyword abstract</li>
        <li>if a class contains an abstract method i.e when a method has no body e.g <b>public abstract void myMethod();</b></li>
        <li>if a class extends an abstract class but doesnot define the abstract methods of the super class</li>
        <li>if a class implements an interface but does not define all the abstract methods of that
            interface, it automatically becomes abstract</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Note: </b>A class can override a concret method of a super class and make it abstract
        ,this can be done if the subclass finds the super class definition invalid in its body</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> Much s an abstract class cant be instatiated ,it can be used as a data
        type for an array of objects such an array of objects can never be initialised e.g if A is abstract then <b>A[] arr = new A[5];</b> is correct but
        <b>arr[0] = new A();</b> is not allowed</p>
    <p>in the example below class Animals is abstract with an abstract method eat, it is extended by two classes
        Lion and Goat which define the abstract method eat making them concrete i.e not abstract and so being able to create objects with out
        causing any error</p>
