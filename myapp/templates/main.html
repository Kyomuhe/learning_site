    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO JAVA</h1>
    <p>Object oriented programming(OOPS) is an approach to programming that breaks a programming
    problem in to objects that interact with each other, java is an object oriented programming language
    other oops languages include python</p>
    
    <p>Java is a popular general-purpose programming language that was created
    in the mid-1990s. It was developed by a team of engineers at Sun Microsystems,
    led by James Gosling, along with Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton.
    The initial version of Java, known as Java 1.0, was released to the public in 1996.</p>
 
    <p>Java is a platform independent language meaning once you write a java program
    you can run it on any operating system such as windows,mac or linux as long as
    it has the jvm(java virtue machine)This approach has revolutionized software development
    by enabling developers to build applications that could be deployed on a wide range of
    devices and platforms.Most programming languages like C and C++ compile written code in machine
    code directly so this runs on a specific platform but java works differently ,instead of compiling
    in machine code directly, java converts all code in to byte code first, byte code is platform independent
    i.e there is no difference between byte code for window and on mac</p>
 
    <p>the jvm is the one that converts byte code to machine code. the advantage of using this
  two step process is that it allows java code to be run on all platforms as long as they have the jvm</p>
